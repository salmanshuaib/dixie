'''
1. PUT dixie.py AT THE ROOT OF THE FOLDER STRUCTURE YOU WANT TO SEARCH, I.E. ONE LEVEL ABOVE THE FOLDER YOU WANT TO SEARCH.
2. RUN dixie.py.
3. ENTER THE NAMES OF THE FILES YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR, SEPARATED BY COMMAS (e.g., cont.html, jessie.py, random.js).
4. A TEXT FILE "file_contents.txt" WILL BE GENERATED THAT YOU CAN USE TO CONVERSE IN CODE WITH ChatGPT.
